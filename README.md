# AR.js aframe location-based extra positioning and rotating
## is it possible to translate xyz and/or rotate an a-entity in a location-based aframe AR.js scene?

- This seems to work with the new-location-based component, but not in the classic component
- But since my GLB animations are not rendering correctly (distorted) in new-location-based component, I need to use the classic component
